## Key Features
Odesca is a super light weight, native comic reader with folder management features that works directly with your local library. Built as an ode to Simple Comic, just point Odesca to your library and start reading.

Distraction-Free Reading Designed for both Western and Eastern comics.
- Smart Spreads: Automatically views double-page spreads correctly.
- Single & Double Page View: Switch views instantly based on your preference.
- Bi-Directional Reading: Support for Right-to-Left (Manga) and Left-to-Right (Comic) navigation.
- Cover Offset: Intelligent handling of single cover pages to keep spreads aligned (with manual toggle).
- Dynamic Fitting: Images automatically scale to fit your window.

Library Management
- Gallery View: Visual grid of your series covers for a true digital library feel.
- Tags & Sort: Mark items as "Favorite" or "To Read" and sort by Date Added, Modified, or A-Z.
- File Management: Rename and delete series or volumes directly from the app.
- Smart History: Odesca remembers exactly where you left off in every series and volume so you can jump right back in.

⚠️ Important: Folder Structure Requirement Odesca relies on a specific file system structure to organize your library. Your folders must follow this 3-layer hierarchy: Library Folder -> Series Folder -> Volume Folder -> Images
- Example: My Manga -> Naruto -> Vol 1 -> 001.jpg
- Note: The series cover thumbnail is generated from the first image of the first volume.

Supported Formats
- Images: JPEG, PNG, WEBP, AVIF.
- Containers: Odesca currently supports folders only. .ZIP, .CBZ, and .CBR files are not currently supported.
